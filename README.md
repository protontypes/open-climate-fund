# OpenClimate.fund

## About the Project

[OpenClimate.fund](https://openclimate.fund) is an initiative by [OpenSustain.tech](https://opensustain.tech) and [Ecosyste.ms](https://ecosyste.ms) to support open source climate and sustainability projects. Open source projects are powering thousands of solutions in the climate and sustainability space. From tracking forest health to designing eco-friendly products, these tools help us build a more sustainable future. The best part on open source is that everyone can see how they work and help make them better.

The main goal is to find more impactful open source projects and support the open source climate and sustainability ecosystem. How it works is as follows:

## What you can do

2. Pick another project: Choose another Open Source to receive 100€ from OpenClimate.fund. Browse the [list of projects](https://opensustain.tech/spreadsheet/) and pick one.
